# LogicProScripter

This repository contains code examples and standalone scripts  for Logic Pro's Scripter MIDI plugin. This repository is offered as a free supplement to [The Complete Guide to Logic Pro's Scripter by Philip Regan](http://books.apple.com/us/book/id1611546793).

Files with the "lpxs" prefix are examples scripts specific to certain aspects of Scripter, and tend to be more code snippets. 

Files with the "oc" prefix are complete scripts which can...
* recreate in Scripter stock MIDI functionality in Logic Pro
* expands upon the Logic Pro supplied scripts in Logic Pro
* Leverages principle taught in [The Complete Guide to Logic Pro's Scripter by Philip Regan](http://books.apple.com/us/book/id1611546793) to show expanded musical possibilities with Scripter.

If you used any of these scripts to make your music, please let me know! 

Pull requests are welcome.
